- Akerman's function
Accroding to the recursive formula, set three condition: 
1. if (m==0)
2. else if (n == 0)
3. else

- powerset
In main function use vector to store elements and pass to powerset function.
In powerset function, there are two condition:
1. if the vector is empty then return 2D vector with one vector contain empty string
2. else recursive call and receive result from powerset function, double the vectors in result and add the first element to half of vectors.
